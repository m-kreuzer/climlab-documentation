Tutorials
=========

For a learning-by-doing approach, a couple of Tutorials come with the `climlab` package. They can be found in the package's `courseware` folder and are written in the Jupyter Notebook format. The first `climlab` notebooks have been used for teaching some basics of climate science and had also the initial purpose to document the ``climlab`` package.

 


**Example usage**

The notebooks are self-describing, and should all run out-of-the-box once the package is installed, e.g.:

	.. code-block:: console
	
		jupyter notebook Insolation.ipynb


**Notebooks**

A few notebooks which describe the basic usage of EBMs, can be found here:
